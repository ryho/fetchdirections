FetchDirections
===============

This is a Java command line application that takes in a permalink to directions on Google Maps, parses it to get the source and destination, submits a Google Maps API request for walking directions, parses the XML that is returned, and saves a text file in the same folder that contains a list of coordinates and steps.
